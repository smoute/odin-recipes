    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Mary Cadogan's aromatic broth will warm you up on a winter's evening - it contains ginger, which is particularly good for colds.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>900ml chicken or vegetable stock (or Miso soup mix)</li>
            <li>1 boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 175g)</li>
            <li>1 tsp chopped fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
            <li>50g rice or wheat noodles</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sweetcorn, canned or frozen</li>
            <li>2-3 mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 spring onions, shredded</li>
            <li>2 tsp soy sauce, plus extra for serving</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Pour the stock into a pan and add the chicken breast, ginger and garlic. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, partly cover and simmer for 20 mins, until the chicken is tender.</li>
        <li>Put the chicken on a board and shred into bite-size pieces using a couple of forks. Return the chicken to the stock with the noodles, sweetcorn, mushrooms, spring onion and soy sauce. Simmer for 3-4 mins until the noodles are tender</li>
        <li>Ladle into two bowls and scatter over the remaining spring onion, mint or basil leaves and chilli, if using. Serve with extra soy sauce.</li>
